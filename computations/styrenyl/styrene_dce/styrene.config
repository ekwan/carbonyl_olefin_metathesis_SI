# isotopomer name, atom number in ground state, atom number in transition state, valid replacement atomic weight (must be specified in weights.dat)
#
# for example, 'isotopomer abc 2 4 C13' replaces atom 2 in the gs and atom 4 in the ts with carbon-13
# and calls the resulting KIE "abc"
#
# add additional isotopomer lines with the same name to give multiple replacements within a single isotopomer
