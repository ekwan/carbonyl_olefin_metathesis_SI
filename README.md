This repository contains code, raw data, and procedures for reproducing the natural abundance carbon KIE measurements and computations reported in the paper.  The information given here would also be useful for applying the DEPT method for measuring KIEs to other chemical systems using Bruker NMR spectrometers.

### Contents

- `NMR/` Bruker scripts, raw data, Jupyter notebooks, and Excel spreadsheets for the acquisition, processing, and analysis of KIE data
- `computations/` Gaussian and ORCA output files, scripts, and summaries to reproduce the computations given in the paper
- `spreadsheets/` SDKIE and Hammett study spreadsheets
